## Development Workflow

### Version Control (Git)
- **Main Branch**: Production-ready code
- **Develop Branch**: Integration branch for features
- **Feature Branches**: Individual feature development
- **Hotfix Branches**: Critical bug fixes

**Branch Naming Convention**:
- `feature/medication-crud`
- `bugfix/notification-timing`
- `hotfix/critical-crash`

### Code Review Process
1. Developer creates feature branch
2. Implements feature with unit tests
3. Creates pull request to develop branch
4. Peer review (minimum 2 approvals)
5. Automated testing pipeline runs
6. Merge to develop after approval
7. Regular merges to main for releases

### Testing Strategy

**Unit Testing**:
- Minimum 80% code coverage
- Test-driven development for core logic
- Mock external dependencies (Firebase)
- Automated test execution in CI/CD

**Integration Testing**:
- Firebase integration tests
- Notification system testing
- Cross-platform compatibility tests
- Performance benchmarking

**User Acceptance Testing**:
- Sprint demo to stakeholders
- User feedback collection
- Usability testing sessions
- Accessibility compliance testing

### Quality Assurance

**Code Quality**:
- Linting and formatting standards
- Code complexity analysis
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Performance profiling

**Documentation**:
- API documentation
- User guides and tutorials
- Technical architecture documentation
- Deployment procedures

### Deployment Process

**Environments**:
- **Development**: Feature testing and integration
- **Staging**: Pre-production testing and demos
- **Production**: Live user environment

**Deployment Pipeline**:
1. Automated testing on feature branches
2. Integration testing on develop branch
3. Staging deployment for UAT
4. Production deployment after approval
5. Post-deployment monitoring and rollback capability

### Risk Management

**Technical Risks**:
- Firebase service limitations
- Platform-specific notification issues
- Data synchronization conflicts
- Performance bottlenecks

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Regular Firebase quota monitoring
- Platform-specific testing protocols
- Conflict resolution algorithms
- Performance testing and optimization

**Project Risks**:
- Scope creep from additional features
- Team member availability
- Third-party API dependencies
- Regulatory compliance requirements

### Communication Plan

**Internal Communication**:
- Daily standups for progress updates
- Weekly technical architecture reviews
- Bi-weekly stakeholder updates
- Monthly retrospectives for process improvement

**External Communication**:
- Sprint demos to product owners
- User feedback collection and analysis
- Healthcare provider consultation (if applicable)
- Regulatory compliance reviews

### Success Metrics

**Development Metrics**:
- Sprint velocity and burndown
- Code coverage percentage
- Bug discovery and resolution time
- Feature completion rate

**Product Metrics**:
- User engagement and retention
- Medication adherence improvement
- App store ratings and reviews
- System uptime and performance
